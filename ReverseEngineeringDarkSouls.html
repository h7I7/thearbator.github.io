							<a><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
                            <p>This is, admittedly, a small-scale project, but the bulk of the time was spent dissecting the Dark Souls Remastered disassembly and gradually understanding its inner workings. One of the key challenges was attaching a debugger which requires DBVM, a risky process that can occasionally result in a Blue Screen of Death. Despite these difficulties, the experience was invaluable, and I’m excited about the possibility of taking on similar challenges in the future. Ideas like infinite stamina or a damage multiplier sound like they'd make for interesting follow-up projects!</p>
							<br>
							<a><h2>Requirements</h2></a>
							<p>To complete this project, you'll need a copy of Dark Souls Remastered and Cheat Engine. Although Cheat Engine is often viewed as just a tool for game cheats, it's actually quite sophisticated for reverse engineering. Its simplicity in enabling cheats is not a flaw, but rather a testament to its effectiveness as a powerful hacking tool.</p>
							<p>For the sake of brevity, I’ll assume you are already familiar with Dark Souls Remastered and general video game mechanics, so I won’t be covering details like game mechanics, menus, locations, or stats. Similarly, this guide won’t focus on the ins and outs of Cheat Engine as a tool. Instead, I’ll be explaining the specific steps I took using Cheat Engine to reverse engineer this application, highlighting the underlying technology and the reverse engineering process rather than the software itself.</p>
							<br>
							<a><h2>Finding the Health Value</h2></a>
							<p>To get started, open Dark Souls Remastered and Cheat Engine, then attach Cheat Engine to the game process (DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED or DarkSoulsRemastered.exe) using the computer icon at the top left [1]. After attaching, create a character and move to a convenient location for testing (I used Firelink Shrine for easy access to a bonfire and enemies).</p>
							<p>Next, find your current health value in the game [2] and enter it into Cheat Engine’s "Value" field [3], ensuring the scan type is set to “Exact Value.” Since most values in Dark Souls are likely stored as 4-byte integers (a common data type in C++), you can use that as a starting point. If you don’t find the value using 4 bytes, try other types, as discussed later.</p>
							<p>Quick Tip: A 4-byte integer (int32) occupies 32 bits of memory (4 bytes = 32 bits). If the value doesn't show up, scan using other common data types like float or double.</p>
							<p>After clicking "New Scan" and/or "First Scan" [4], a list of matching addresses will appear. These addresses correspond to memory locations where the health value might be stored. Now, take damage in the game (I did this by getting hit by a skeleton) and use "Next Scan" to search for the updated health value [5].</p>
