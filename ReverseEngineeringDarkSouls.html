							<a><h2>Introduction</h2></a>
                            <p>This is, admittedly, a small-scale project, but the bulk of the time was spent dissecting the Dark Souls Remastered disassembly and gradually understanding its inner workings. One of the key challenges was attaching a debugger which requires DBVM, a risky process that can occasionally result in a Blue Screen of Death. Despite these difficulties, the experience was invaluable, and I’m excited about the possibility of taking on similar challenges in the future. Ideas like infinite stamina or a damage multiplier sound like they'd make for interesting follow-up projects!</p>
							<br>
							<a><h2>Requirements</h2></a>
							<p>To complete this project, you'll need a copy of Dark Souls Remastered and Cheat Engine. Although Cheat Engine is often viewed as just a tool for game cheats, it's actually quite sophisticated for reverse engineering. Its simplicity in enabling cheats is not a flaw, but rather a testament to its effectiveness as a powerful hacking tool.</p>
							<p>For the sake of brevity, I’ll assume you are already familiar with Dark Souls Remastered and general video game mechanics, so I won’t be covering details like game mechanics, menus, locations, or stats. Similarly, this guide won’t focus on the ins and outs of Cheat Engine as a tool. Instead, I’ll be explaining the specific steps I took using Cheat Engine to reverse engineer this application, highlighting the underlying technology and the reverse engineering process rather than the software itself.</p>
							<br>
							<a><h2>Finding the Health Value</h2></a>
							<p>To get started, open Dark Souls Remastered and Cheat Engine, then attach Cheat Engine to the game process (DARK SOULS™: REMASTERED or DarkSoulsRemastered.exe) using the computer icon at the top left [1]. After attaching, create a character and move to a convenient location for testing (I used Firelink Shrine for easy access to a bonfire and enemies).</p>
							<p>Next, find your current health value in the game [2] and enter it into Cheat Engine’s "Value" field [3], ensuring the scan type is set to “Exact Value.” Since most values in Dark Souls are likely stored as 4-byte integers (a common data type in C++), you can use that as a starting point. If you don’t find the value using 4 bytes, try other types, as discussed later.</p>
							<p>Quick Tip: A 4-byte integer (int32) occupies 32 bits of memory (4 bytes = 32 bits). If the value doesn't show up, scan using other common data types like float or double.</p>
							<p>After clicking "New Scan" and/or "First Scan" [4], a list of matching addresses will appear. These addresses correspond to memory locations where the health value might be stored. Now, take damage in the game (I did this by getting hit by a skeleton) and use "Next Scan" to search for the updated health value [5].</p>

							</a>
							</center>
							<br>
							<a><h2>Finding the Health Pointer</h2></a>
							<p>We now have our health value in Cheat Engine, but if we were to close and reopen Dark Souls, that value would no longer be valid. This is because the health value is stored on the heap, which is dynamically allocated memory. To solve this, we need to find a series of pointers that lead to our health value, starting from a stable memory location on the stack. This allows us to reliably locate the correct memory address every time the program runs, as the heap’s dynamic memory allocation changes between runs.</p>
							<p>The next step involves attaching a debugger to Dark Souls. As mentioned earlier, this requires DBVM, which carries some risks, such as system crashes. You can attempt to attach a regular debugger, but the game will most likely detect it and crash as a result. Additionally, if you're trying any of these methods, make sure to start the game in 'Offline Mode' to avoid getting banned from Dark Souls. For more information about DBVM, you can read <u><a href="https://wiki.cheatengine.org/index.php?title=DBVM" target="_Blank">Cheat Engine's page on DBVM.</a></u></p>
							<p>To find our health pointer, we need to identify the code that accesses the memory address where the health value is stored. To do this, right-click the value in Cheat Engine and select "Find out what writes to this address" [1]. A pop-up will prompt you to attach a debugger, and you’ll get a warning about DBVM, click "Yes" to both. Once the DBVM debugger is running, try to move quickly, as leaving it running for too long can lead to a system crash. Be sure to take some damage in-game and then stop the debugger.</p>
							<p>You’ll now see a window displaying the ‘Counts’ and ‘Instructions’ [2]. The ‘Count’ shows how many times the code was executed, while the ‘Instruction’ lists the memory location, hex opcodes, and the assembly (ASM) disassembly. Double-click on the instruction with the fewest calls or the one triggered when you took damage, as this is likely the one tied to your health value. A new window will appear showing the disassembly around the selected instruction [3] as well as the stack frame at the time the instruction was executed [4]. For more information on stack frame layout in x86-64 architecture, check out this <a href="https://eli.thegreenplace.net/2011/09/06/stack-frame-layout-on-x86-64" target="_Blank">article by Eli Bendersky</a>.</p>
							<p>In this 'Extra Info' window you can also see that Cheat Engine has kindly suggested the value of the pointer needed to find this address [5]. We won't be using this though as I am interested in finding this value manually.</p>

							</a>
							</center>
							<p>For example, the instruction might look like this: <code>mov [rbx+000003E8],eax</code></p>
							<p>Here, the value in the <code>eax</code> register is being written to the memory location <code>[rbx+000003E8]</code>, which corresponds to the current address <code>0D51B538</code>. We can treat this like a simple equation: <code>[rbx+000003E8] = 0D51B538</code></p>
							<p>This allows us to calculate the base pointer by subtracting the offset: <code>rbx = 0D51B538 - 000003E8 = 0D51B150</code></p>
							<p>To be fair, we could have simply looked at the <code>rbx</code> register, as it already contains the base pointer, which is exactly what Cheat Engine suggested in the first place. However, going through the manual process of calculating it helps reinforce understanding of how these memory addresses and pointers work in practice.</p>
							<hr>
							<br>
							<p>So now we have the base pointer for our health, we're done! Or are we... Unfortunately, the base pointer we just found is still on the heap and will be invalid after the application restarts. What we're actually looking for is pointer on the stack, which will look like this: <code>DarkSoulsRemastered.exe+???????</code>. These pointers are the holy grail and never change location between application runs. </p>
							<p>Let's recap, from our example we now know that <code>[<b>0D51B150</b>+000003E8] = 0D51B538</code>. So now we want to search for our base pointer: <code><b>0D51B150</b></code>. To do this, check the 'Hex' box in Cheat Engine, paste the base pointer into the search box, and start a scan. This will search for memory addresses that point to our base pointer.</p>
							<p>We now have a list of all the values that are a pointer to our base pointer. There are quite a lot of results, so we’ll need to narrow them down. To start I would suggest hitting "Next Scan" a few times but this probably won't do much, so we need to put our detective hats on. This is usually the point where I will get stuck for hours, days, weeks, or even much longer as there is no guarantee that we will find what we need, there might be red herrings, and lets not forget that applications are not designed to be reversed.</p>
							<p>One approach would be to go through all of these values one-by-one and run "Find out what accesses this address" on them, scouring through all of the intructions and reading dissasembly to try and see if it's relevant to what we're looking for. I've done this and I wouldn't recommend this unless you are desperate. For now let's try and spot the best starting point, looking at the list of values we can see there are many that begin with 0, many that begin with 2, but only one value that begins with 1. This seems like a promising lead, so I’ll start my search here and see if it reveals a pointer that leads to a stable memory address.</p>
